Each block specifies:\\\\\\\\n - **What file** to modify (with full path)\\\\\\\\n - **What content** to find (SEARCH section)\\\\\\\\n - **What to replace** it with (REPLACE section)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ## Block Format:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Every *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this exact format:\\\\\\\\n 1. Opening fence with language: ```python\\\\\\\\n 2. Operation type and file path: `+++++++` or `-------` followed by the *FULL* file path\\\\\\\\n 3. Search marker: <<<<<<< SEARCH\\\\\\\\n 4. Content to find (can be empty)\\\\\\\\n 5. Divider: =======\\\\\\\\n 6. Content to replace with (can be empty)\\\\\\\\n 7. Replace marker: >>>>>>> REPLACE\\\\\\\\n 8. Closing fence: ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ## Operation Types:\\\\\\\\n - `+++++++` for **editing** existing files or **creating** new files\\\\\\\\n - `-------` for **removing** files or **replacing entire file contents**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ## Examples:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **Create a new file:**\\\\\\\\n ```python\\\\\\\\n +++++++ mathweb/flask/app.py\\\\\\\\n <<<<<<< SEARCH\\\\\\\\n =======\\\\\\\\n import math\\\\\\\\n from flask import Flask\\\\\\\\n >>>>>>> REPLACE\\\\\\\\n ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **Edit existing file content:**\\\\\\\\n ```python\\\\\\\\n +++++++ mathweb/flask/app.py\\\\\\\\n <<<<<<< SEARCH\\\\\\\\n from flask import Flask\\\\\\\\n =======\\\\\\\\n import math\\\\\\\\n from flask import Flask\\\\\\\\n >>>>>>> REPLACE\\\\\\\\n ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n**Remove entire file:**\\\\\\\\n ```python\\\\\\\\n ------- mathweb/flask/app.py\\\\\\\\n <<<<<<< SEARCH\\\\\\\\n =======\\\\\\\\n >>>>>>> REPLACE\\\\\\\\n ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n **Replace all file contents:**\\\\\\\\n ```python\\\\\\\\n ------- mathweb/flask/app.py\\\\\\\\n <<<<<<< SEARCH\\\\\\\\n =======\\\\\\\\n import math\\\\\\\\n from flask import Flask\\\\\\\\n >>>>>>> REPLACE\\\\\\\\n ```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n ## **CRITICAL RULES:**\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n File Paths:\\\\\\\\n - Use the FULL file path exactly as shown by the user\\\\\\\\n - No bold asterisks, quotes, or escaping around the path\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Search Content:\\\\\\\\n - Must EXACTLY MATCH existing file content, character for character\\\\\\\\n - Include all comments, docstrings, whitespace, etc.\\\\\\\\n - If file contains wrapped/escaped content, match the literal file contents\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n Block Strategy:\\\\\\\\n - Keep blocks small and focused\\\\\\\\n - Use multiple blocks for multiple changes to the same file\\\\\\\\n - Include enough context lines to make each search unique\\\\\\\\n - Only replace the first occurrence found\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n File Operations:\\\\\\\\n - Only edit files that the user has added to the chat\\\\\\\\n - For new files: use +++++++ with empty SEARCH, content in REPLACE\\\\\\\\n - To move code: use 2 blocks (1 to delete, 1 to insert)\\\\\\\\n - To rename files: use shell commands after your response\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n User Intent:\\\\\\\\n - If user says \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ok\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"go ahead\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", or \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"do that\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" \\\\\\\\u2192 provide SEARCH/REPLACE blocks\\\\\\\\n -

These standards are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency.\\\\\\\\n                ## Convention: COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Comment Styling Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines the best practices for writing comments in this repository. The goal is to maintain clarity and consistency across all code, regardless of the programming language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Principles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Explain the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Not the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, or the intent behind a piece of code that might not be immediately obvious.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Keep it Concise**: Write short, clear sentences. Avoid long narratives.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Placement**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - Place comments on the line immediately preceding the code block they describe.\\\\\\\\n   - Inline comments can be used to clarify individual lines, arguments, or variable declarations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Formatting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with the comment character followed by a single space (e.g., `# `, `// `).\\\\\\\\n- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n- For multi-line comments, each line should begin with the comment character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Function Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor functions, methods, or reusable components, provide a summary that includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A brief description of its purpose.\\\\\\\\n1. An example of usage, including input and expected output.\\\\\\\\n1. (Optional) Type signatures if the language is dynamically typed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example (Nix)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```nix\\\\\\\\n# a basic function to fetch a specified user's public keys from github .keys url\\\\\\\\n# `fetchKeys \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"username` -> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ssh-rsa AAAA...== username@hostname\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n#@ String -> String\\\\\\\\nfetchKeys = username: (builtins.fetchurl \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://github.com/${username}.keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse standard tags to highlight specific information:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` for planned features or improvements.\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` for known issues that need to be addressed.\\\\\\\\n# Comment Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Formatting\\\\\\\\n- Use inline comments sparingly; prefer clear code over explanatory comments\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with capital letter, end with period for complete sentences\\\\\\\\n- Place comments on separate line above code, not trailing\\\\\\\\n- Use double-quote docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Docstring Patterns\\\\\\\\n- Required for all public classes, methods, and functions\\\\\\\\n- Format: Brief summary, blank line, detailed explanation, blank line, usage examples\\\\\\\\n- Include type information via type hints, not in docstrings\\\\\\\\n- Usage examples should show real-world invocation patterns\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nasync def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike], mode: FileMode) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Add a file to the active context for AI awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Supports wildcard patterns like 'byte/*' to add multiple files at once.\\\\\\\\n    Only adds files that are available in the FileDiscoveryService to ensure\\\\\\\\n    they are valid project files that respect gitignore patterns.\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/*.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)` -> adds all Python files\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` - Planned feature or enhancement, include description\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` - Known bug or issue that needs attention\\\\\\\\n- `NOTE:` - Important explanation about non-obvious implementation\\\\\\\\n- Avoid `HACK:` and `XXX:` - refactor code instead\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Explain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u274c `# Set the container` (obvious from code)\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u2705 `# Store reference for complex initialization where container is needed beyond register/boot`\\\\\\\\n- Focus on business logic, architectural decisions, and non-obvious requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Convention: PROJECT_TOOLING.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Project Tooling\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Build System\\\\\\\\n- **uv**: Modern Python package installer and resolver\\\\\\\\n- **pyproject.toml**: Project configuration, dependencies, and tool settings\\\\\\\\n- Build backend: `uv_build` (>= 0.8.10, < 0.9.0)\\\\\\\\n- Python: >= 3.12 required\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key Dependencies\\\\\\\\n- **LangChain/LangGraph**: AI agent framework with graph-based workflows\\\\\\\\n- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management (v2.11+)\\\\\\\\n- **Rich**: Terminal UI rendering and formatting\\\\\\\\n- **Click**: CLI framework (entry point: `byte.core.cli:cli`)\\\\\\\\n- **prompt-toolkit**: Interactive command-line interface\\\\\\\\n- **GitPython**: Git repository operations\\\\\\\\n- **watchfiles**: File system monitoring\\\\\\\\n- **ripgrepy**: Fast file searching\\\\\\\\n- **aiosqlite**: Async database for checkpointing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Development Tools\\\\\\\\n- **Ruff**: Linting and formatting (replaces black, isort, flake8)\\\\\\\\n  - Target: Python 3.12\\\\\\\\n  - Enabled rules: E, F, I, LOG, UP, T10, ISC, ICN, G, PIE, PT, Q, RSE, FURB, RUF\\\\\\\\n  - Config: see [tool.ruff] in pyproject.toml\\\\\\\\n- **pytest**: Testing framework with async support (pytest-asyncio)\\\\\\\\n- **basedpyright**: Type checking (basic mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Environment Setup\\\\\\\\n- Use `.python-version` for version pinning (3.12)\\\\\\\\n- Optional: Nix flakes for reproducible environment (flake.nix)\\\\\\\\n- Optional: direnv for automatic environment activation (.envrc)\\\\\\\\n- Install: `uv sync` (installs all dependencies including dev group)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Running\\\\\\\\n- Entry point: `uv run byte` or install and use `byte` command\\\\\\\\n- Scripts defined in pyproject.toml: `scripts.byte = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"byte.core.cli:cli\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Convention: PYTHON_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines Python coding standards for this project, based on established patterns in the codebase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Type Annotations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Always use type hints** for all public methods, parameters, and return values\\\\\\\\n- Use `Union[str, PathLike]` for flexible path handling\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable values\\\\\\\\n- Import types under `TYPE_CHECKING` when needed to avoid circular imports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional, Union\\\\\\\\nfrom os import PathLike\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\\\\\\\\n    from byte.container import Container\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef process_file(path: Union[str, PathLike]) -> Optional[str]:\\\\\\\\n    pass\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Dataclasses**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutable data containers\\\\\\\\n- **Abstract classes**: Use `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` for interfaces\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Accept container in `__init__` with proper typing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\\\\\\\nclass FileContext:\\\\\\\\n    path: Path\\\\\\\\n    mode: FileMode\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nclass Command(ABC):\\\\\\\\n    def __init__(self, container: Optional[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Container\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = None):\\\\\\\\n        self.container = container\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Class docstrings**: Brief purpose + usage example\\\\\\\\n- **Method docstrings**: Purpose + usage example for public methods\\\\\\\\n- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code\\\\\\\\n- **Comment style**: Follow the [Comment Style Guide](COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md) for formatting and placement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nclass FileService:\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Domain service orchestrating file operations and context management.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await file_service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)`\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    def add_file(self, path: Union[str,

manager.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions, not broad `Exception`\\\\\\\\n- **Graceful degradation**: Return `False`/`None` rather than raising for expected failures\\\\\\\\n- **Resource cleanup**: Use context managers when appropriate\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntry:\\\\\\\\n    return self.path.read_text(encoding=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"utf-8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError):\\\\\\\\n    return None\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Code Organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Single responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Use container pattern for loose coupling\\\\\\\\n- **Event-driven**: Emit events for cross-domain communication\\\\\\\\n- **Immutable data**: Prefer immutable objects where possible\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (`FileService`)\\\\\\\\n- **Methods/variables**: snake_case (`add_file`)\\\\\\\\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`FILE_MODE`)\\\\\\\\n- **Private members**: Leading underscore (`_files`)\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.12+ required\\\\\\\\n- Use tabs for indentation (see .editorconfig)\\\\\\\\n- Ruff for linting and formatting (see pyproject.toml)\\\\\\\\n- Type hints mandatory for function signatures\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Imports\\\\\\\\n- Organize: stdlib, third-party, local (Ruff isort with combine-as-imports)\\\\\\\\n- Use absolute imports from `byte.` package root\\\\\\\\n- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies\\\\\\\\n- Example: `from byte.core.service.base_service import Service`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\n- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `FileService`, `CommandRegistry`)\\\\\\\\n- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `async def boot()`, `get_graph()`)\\\\\\\\n- Private methods: leading underscore (e.g., `_handle_stream_event()`)\\\\\\\\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (rare, prefer config classes)\\\\\\\\n- Service/Provider suffix for framework classes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Async/Await\\\\\\\\n- Prefer async/await for I/O operations\\\\\\\\n- All service methods should be async\\\\\\\\n- Use `await self.make(ServiceClass)` for dependency injection\\\\\\\\n- Example: `file_service = await self.make(FileService)`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Type Hints\\\\\\\\n- Required for all function signatures\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable, `Union[A, B]` for alternatives\\\\\\\\n- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Type` from typing module\\\\\\\\n- Example: `async def execute(self, request: Any, thread_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\n- Inherit from base classes: `Service`, `Command`, `Agent`, `Node`\\\\\\\\n- Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns: `Bootable`, `Injectable`, `Eventable`, `Configurable`\\\\\\\\n- Implement required abstract methods from base classes\\\\\\\\n- Override `async def boot()` for initialization logic\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\n- Create custom exceptions inheriting from domain-specific base (e.g., `EditFormatError`)\\\\\\\\n- Use descriptive exception names (e.g., `ReadOnlyFileError`, `SearchContentNotFoundError`)\\\\\\\\n- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully in long-running operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Project Structure\\\\\\\\n- Domain-driven design: `src/byte/domain/{domain}/`\\\\\\\\n- Each domain has: `config.py`, `service_provider.py`, `service/`, `command/`\\\\\\\\n- Core framework in `src/byte/core/`\\\\\\\\n- Tests mirror source structure in `src/tests/`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"], [\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\", \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n# System Context\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nCurrent date: 2025-10-07\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\"]], \\\\\\\"file_context\\\\\\\":

Conventions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                **Important:** Adhere to the following project-specific conventions. These standards are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n                ## Convention: COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Comment Styling Guide\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines the best practices for writing comments in this repository. The goal is to maintain clarity and consistency across all code, regardless of the programming language.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## General Principles\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Explain the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Not the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, or the intent behind a piece of code that might not be immediately obvious.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Keep it Concise**: Write short, clear sentences. Avoid long narratives.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. **Placement**:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Place comments on the line immediately preceding the code block they describe.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n   - Inline comments can be used to clarify individual lines, arguments, or variable declarations.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Formatting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with the comment character followed by a single space (e.g., `# `, `// `).\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- For multi-line comments, each line should begin with the comment character.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Function Documentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nFor functions, methods, or reusable components, provide a summary that includes:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. A brief description of its purpose.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. An example of usage, including input and expected output.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n1. (Optional) Type signatures if the language is dynamically typed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n### Example (Nix)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```nix\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# a basic function to fetch a specified user's public keys from github .keys url\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# `fetchKeys \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"username` -> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ssh-rsa AAAA...== username@hostname\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n#@ String -> String\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfetchKeys = username: (builtins.fetchurl \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://github.com/${username}.keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nUse standard tags to highlight specific information:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` for planned features or improvements.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` for known issues that need to be addressed.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Comment Style Guide\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## General Formatting\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use inline comments sparingly; prefer clear code over explanatory comments\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with capital letter, end with period for complete sentences\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Place comments on separate line above code, not trailing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use double-quote docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Docstring Patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Required for all public classes, methods, and functions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Format: Brief summary, blank line, detailed explanation, blank line, usage examples\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Include type information via type hints, not in docstrings\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Usage examples should show real-world invocation patterns\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nasync def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike], mode: FileMode) -> bool:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Add a

once.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Only adds files that are available in the FileDiscoveryService to ensure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    they are valid project files that respect gitignore patterns.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/*.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)` -> adds all Python files\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` - Planned feature or enhancement, include description\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` - Known bug or issue that needs

Convention: PYTHON_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines Python coding standards for this project, based on established patterns in the codebase.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Type Annotations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Always use type hints** for all public methods, parameters, and return values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use `Union[str, PathLike]` for flexible path handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable values\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Import types under `TYPE_CHECKING` when needed to avoid circular imports\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional, Union\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nfrom os import PathLike\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    from byte.container import Container\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ndef process_file(path: Union[str, PathLike]) -> Optional[str]:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    pass\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Dataclasses**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutable data containers\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Abstract classes**: Use `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` for interfaces\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Accept container in `__init__` with proper typing\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nclass FileContext:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    path: Path\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    mode: FileMode\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nclass Command(ABC):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    def __init__(self, container: Optional[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Container\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = None):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        self.container = container\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Documentation\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Class docstrings**: Brief purpose + usage example\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Method docstrings**: Purpose + usage example for public methods\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Comment style**: Follow the [Comment Style Guide](COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md) for formatting and placement\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nclass FileService:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Domain service orchestrating file operations and context management.\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await file_service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"main.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n

FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions, not broad `Exception`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Graceful degradation**: Return `False`/`None` rather than raising for expected failures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Resource cleanup**: Use context managers when appropriate\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ntry:\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    return self.path.read_text(encoding=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"utf-8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError):\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n    return None\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Code Organization\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Single responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Use container pattern for loose coupling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Event-driven**: Emit events for cross-domain communication\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Immutable data**: Prefer immutable objects where possible\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (`FileService`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Methods/variables**: snake_case (`add_file`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`FILE_MODE`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- **Private members**: Leading underscore (`_files`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## General\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.12+ required\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use tabs for indentation (see .editorconfig)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Ruff for linting and formatting (see pyproject.toml)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Type hints mandatory for function signatures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Imports\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Organize: stdlib, third-party, local (Ruff isort with combine-as-imports)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use absolute imports from `byte.` package root\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Example: `from byte.core.service.base_service import Service`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `FileService`, `CommandRegistry`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `async def boot()`, `get_graph()`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Private methods: leading underscore (e.g., `_handle_stream_event()`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (rare, prefer config classes)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Service/Provider suffix for framework classes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Async/Await\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Prefer async/await for I/O operations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- All service methods should be async\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use `await self.make(ServiceClass)` for dependency injection\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Example: `file_service = await self.make(FileService)`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Type Hints\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Required for all function signatures\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable, `Union[A, B]` for alternatives\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Type` from typing module\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Example: `async def execute(self, request: Any, thread_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Inherit from base classes: `Service`, `Command`, `Agent`, `Node`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns: `Bootable`, `Injectable`, `Eventable`, `Configurable`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Implement required abstract methods from base classes\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Override `async def boot()` for initialization logic\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Create custom exceptions inheriting from domain-specific base (e.g., `EditFormatError`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Use descriptive exception names (e.g., `ReadOnlyFileError`, `SearchContentNotFoundError`)\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully in long-running operations\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n## Project Structure\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Domain-driven design: `src/byte/domain/{domain}/`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Each domain has: `config.py`, `service_provider.py`, `service/`, `command/`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Core framework in `src/byte/core/`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n- Tests mirror source structure in `src/tests/`\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"], [\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"user\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\",

the following project-specific conventions. These standards are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency.\\\\\\\\n                ## Convention: COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Comment Styling Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines the best practices for writing comments in this repository. The goal is to maintain clarity and consistency across all code, regardless of the programming language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Principles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Explain the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Not the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, or the intent behind a piece of code that might not be immediately obvious.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Keep it Concise**: Write short, clear sentences. Avoid long narratives.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Placement**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - Place comments on the line immediately preceding the code block they describe.\\\\\\\\n   - Inline comments can be used to clarify individual lines, arguments, or variable declarations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Formatting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with the comment character followed by a single space (e.g., `# `, `// `).\\\\\\\\n- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n- For multi-line comments, each line should begin with the comment character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Function Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor functions, methods, or reusable components, provide a summary that includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A brief description of its purpose.\\\\\\\\n1. An example of usage, including input and expected output.\\\\\\\\n1. (Optional) Type signatures if the language is dynamically typed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example (Nix)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```nix\\\\\\\\n# a basic function to fetch a specified user's public keys from github .keys url\\\\\\\\n# `fetchKeys \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"username` -> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ssh-rsa AAAA...== username@hostname\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n#@ String -> String\\\\\\\\nfetchKeys = username: (builtins.fetchurl \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://github.com/${username}.keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse standard tags to highlight specific information:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` for planned features or improvements.\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` for known issues that need to be addressed.\\\\\\\\n# Comment Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Formatting\\\\\\\\n- Use inline comments sparingly; prefer clear code over explanatory comments\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with capital letter, end with period for complete sentences\\\\\\\\n- Place comments on separate line above code, not trailing\\\\\\\\n- Use double-quote docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Docstring Patterns\\\\\\\\n- Required for all public classes, methods, and functions\\\\\\\\n- Format: Brief summary, blank line, detailed explanation, blank line, usage examples\\\\\\\\n- Include type information via type hints, not in docstrings\\\\\\\\n- Usage examples should show real-world invocation patterns\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nasync def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike], mode: FileMode) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Add a file to the active context for AI awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Supports wildcard patterns like 'byte/*' to add multiple files at once.\\\\\\\\n    Only adds files that are available in the FileDiscoveryService to ensure\\\\\\\\n    they are valid project files that respect gitignore patterns.\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/*.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)` -> adds all Python files\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` - Planned feature or enhancement, include description\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` - Known bug or issue that needs attention\\\\\\\\n- `NOTE:` - Important explanation about non-obvious implementation\\\\\\\\n- Avoid `HACK:` and `XXX:` - refactor code instead\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Explain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u274c `# Set the container` (obvious from code)\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u2705 `# Store reference for complex initialization where container is needed beyond register/boot`\\\\\\\\n- Focus on business logic, architectural decisions, and non-obvious requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Convention: PROJECT_TOOLING.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Project Tooling\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Build System\\\\\\\\n- **uv**: Modern Python package installer and

These standards are essential for maintaining code quality and consistency.\\n                ## Convention: COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md\\n\\n# Comment Styling Guide\\n\\nThis guide outlines the best practices for writing comments in this repository. The goal is to maintain clarity and consistency across all code, regardless of the programming language.\\n\\n## General Principles\\n\\n1. **Explain the \\\"Why\\\", Not the \\\"What\\\"**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, or the intent behind a piece of code that might not be immediately obvious.\\n\\n1. **Keep it Concise**: Write short, clear sentences. Avoid long narratives.\\n\\n1. **Placement**:\\n\\n   - Place comments on the line immediately preceding the code block they describe.\\n   - Inline comments can be used to clarify individual lines, arguments, or variable declarations.\\n\\n## Formatting\\n\\n- Start comments with the comment character followed by a single space (e.g., `# `, `// `).\\n- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.\\n- For multi-line comments, each line should begin with the comment character.\\n\\n## Function Documentation\\n\\nFor functions, methods, or reusable components, provide a summary that includes:\\n\\n1. A brief description of its purpose.\\n1. An example of usage, including input and expected output.\\n1. (Optional) Type signatures if the language is dynamically typed.\\n\\n### Example (Nix)\\n\\n```nix\\n# a basic function to fetch a specified user's public keys from github .keys url\\n# `fetchKeys \\\"username` -> \\\"ssh-rsa AAAA...== username@hostname\\\"\\n#@ String -> String\\nfetchKeys = username: (builtins.fetchurl \\\"https://github.com/${username}.keys\\\");\\n```\\n\\n## Special Tags\\n\\nUse standard tags to highlight specific information:\\n\\n- `TODO:` for planned features or improvements.\\n- `FIXME:` for known issues that need to be addressed.\\n# Comment Style Guide\\n\\n## General Formatting\\n- Use inline comments sparingly; prefer clear code over explanatory comments\\n- Start comments with capital letter, end with period for complete sentences\\n- Place comments on separate line above code, not trailing\\n- Use double-quote docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions\\n\\n## Docstring Patterns\\n- Required for all public classes, methods, and functions\\n- Format: Brief summary, blank line, detailed explanation, blank line, usage examples\\n- Include type information via type hints, not in docstrings\\n- Usage examples should show real-world invocation patterns\\n\\nExample:\\n```python\\nasync def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike], mode: FileMode) -> bool:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Add a file to the active context for AI awareness.\\n\\n    Supports wildcard patterns like 'byte/*' to add multiple files at once.\\n    Only adds files that are available in the FileDiscoveryService to ensure\\n    they are valid project files that respect gitignore patterns.\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\"config.py\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\"src/*.py\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)` -> adds all Python files\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Special Tags\\n- `TODO:` - Planned feature or enhancement, include description\\n- `FIXME:` - Known bug or issue that needs attention\\n- `NOTE:` - Important explanation about non-obvious implementation\\n- Avoid `HACK:` and `XXX:` - refactor code instead\\n\\n## Explain \\\"Why\\\" Not \\\"What\\\"\\n- \\u274c `# Set the container` (obvious from code)\\n- \\u2705 `# Store reference for complex initialization where container is needed beyond register/boot`\\n- Focus on business logic, architectural decisions, and non-obvious requirements\\n\\n\\n## Convention: PROJECT_TOOLING.md\\n\\n# Project Tooling\\n\\n## Build System\\n- **uv**: Modern Python package installer and resolver\\n- **pyproject.toml**: Project configuration, dependencies, and tool settings\\n- Build backend: `uv_build` (>= 0.8.10, < 0.9.0)\\n- Python: >= 3.12 required\\n\\n## Key Dependencies\\n- **LangChain/LangGraph**: AI agent framework with graph-based workflows\\n- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management (v2.11+)\\n- **Rich**: Terminal UI rendering and formatting\\n- **Click**: CLI framework (entry point: `byte.core.cli:cli`)\\n- **prompt-toolkit**: Interactive command-line interface\\n- **GitPython**: Git repository operations\\n- **watchfiles**: File system monitoring\\n- **ripgrepy**: Fast file searching\\n- **aiosqlite**: Async database for checkpointing\\n\\n## Development Tools\\n- **Ruff**: Linting and formatting (replaces black, isort, flake8)\\n  - Target: Python 3.12\\n  - Enabled rules: E, F, I, LOG, UP, T10, ISC, ICN, G, PIE, PT, Q, RSE, FURB, RUF\\n  - Config: see [tool.ruff] in pyproject.toml\\n- **pytest**: Testing framework with async support (pytest-asyncio)\\n- **basedpyright**: Type checking (basic mode)\\n\\n## Environment Setup\\n- Use `.python-version` for version pinning (3.12)\\n- Optional: Nix flakes for reproducible environment (flake.nix)\\n- Optional: direnv for automatic environment activation (.envrc)\\n- Install: `uv sync` (installs all dependencies including dev group)\\n\\n## Running\\n- Entry point: `uv run byte` or install and use `byte` command\\n- Scripts defined in pyproject.toml: `scripts.byte = \\\"byte.core.cli:cli\\\"`\\n\\n## Convention: PYTHON_STYLEGUIDE.md\\n\\n# Python Style Guide\\n\\nThis guide outlines Python coding standards for this project, based on established patterns in the codebase.\\n\\n## Type Annotations\\n\\n- **Always use type hints** for all public methods, parameters, and return values\\n- Use `Union[str, PathLike]` for flexible path handling\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable values\\n- Import types under `TYPE_CHECKING` when needed to avoid circular imports\\n\\n```python\\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional, Union\\nfrom os import PathLike\\n\\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\\n    from byte.container import Container\\n\\ndef process_file(path: Union[str, PathLike]) -> Optional[str]:\\n    pass\\n```\\n\\n## Class Design\\n\\n- **Dataclasses**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutable data containers\\n- **Abstract classes**: Use `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` for interfaces\\n- **Dependency injection**: Accept container in `__init__` with proper typing\\n\\n```python\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\nclass FileContext:\\n    path: Path\\n    mode: FileMode\\n\\nclass Command(ABC):\\n    def __init__(self, container: Optional[\\\"Container\\\"] = None):\\n        self.container = container\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\n- **Class docstrings**: Brief purpose + usage example\\n- **Method docstrings**: Purpose + usage example for public methods\\n- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code\\n- **Comment style**: Follow the [Comment Style Guide](COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md) for formatting and placement\\n\\n```python\\nclass FileService:\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"Domain service orchestrating file operations and context management.\\n\\n    Usage: `await file_service.add_file(\\\"main.py\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)`\\n    \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n\\n    def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike]) -> bool:\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"Add a file to the active context with validation.\\n\\n        Usage: `success = manager.add_file(\\\"config.py\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\n        \\\"\\\"\\\"\\n```\\n\\n## Error Handling\\n\\n- **Specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions, not broad `Exception`\\n- **Graceful degradation**: Return `False`/`None` rather than raising for expected failures\\n- **Resource cleanup**: Use context managers when appropriate\\n\\n```python\\ntry:\\n    return self.path.read_text(encoding=\\\"utf-8\\\")\\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError):\\n    return None\\n```\\n\\n## Code Organization\\n\\n- **Single responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose\\n- **Dependency injection**: Use container pattern for loose coupling\\n- **Event-driven**: Emit events for cross-domain communication\\n- **Immutable data**: Prefer immutable objects where possible\\n\\n## Naming Conventions\\n\\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (`FileService`)\\n- **Methods/variables**: snake_case (`add_file`)\\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`FILE_MODE`)\\n- **Private members**: Leading underscore (`_files`)\\n# Python Style Guide\\n\\n## General\\n- Python 3.12+ required\\n- Use tabs for indentation (see .editorconfig)\\n- Ruff for linting and formatting (see pyproject.toml)\\n- Type hints mandatory for function signatures\\n\\n## Imports\\n- Organize: stdlib, third-party, local (Ruff isort with combine-as-imports)\\n- Use absolute imports from `byte.` package root\\n- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies\\n- Example: `from byte.core.service.base_service import Service`\\n\\n## Naming Conventions\\n- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `FileService`, `CommandRegistry`)\\n- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `async def boot()`, `get_graph()`)\\n- Private methods: leading underscore (e.g., `_handle_stream_event()`)\\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (rare, prefer config classes)\\n- Service/Provider suffix for framework classes\\n\\n## Async/Await\\n- Prefer async/await for I/O operations\\n- All service methods should be async\\n- Use `await self.make(ServiceClass)` for dependency injection\\n- Example: `file_service = await self.make(FileService)`\\n\\n## Type Hints\\n- Required for all function signatures\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable, `Union[A, B]` for alternatives\\n- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Type` from typing module\\n- Example: `async def execute(self, request: Any, thread_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:`\\n\\n## Class Design\\n- Inherit from base classes: `Service`, `Command`, `Agent`, `Node`\\n- Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns: `Bootable`, `Injectable`, `Eventable`, `Configurable`\\n- Implement required abstract methods from base classes\\n- Override `async def boot()` for initialization logic\\n\\n## Error Handling\\n- Create custom exceptions inheriting from domain-specific base (e.g., `EditFormatError`)\\n- Use descriptive exception names (e.g., `ReadOnlyFileError`, `SearchContentNotFoundError`)\\n- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully in long-running operations\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n- Domain-driven design: `src/byte/domain/{domain}/`\\n- Each domain has: `config.py`, `service_provider.py`, `service/`, `command/`\\n- Core framework in `src/byte/core/`\\n- Tests mirror source structure in `src/tests/`\\n\\n\"], [\"user\", \"\\n# System Context\\n\\nCurrent date: 2025-10-07\\n\"]], \"file_context\": \"# Here are the files in the current context:\\n\\n\\n*Trust this
