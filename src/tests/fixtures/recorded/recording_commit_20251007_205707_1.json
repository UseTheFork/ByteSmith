The goal is to maintain clarity and consistency across all code, regardless of the programming language.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Principles\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Explain the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", Not the \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"**: Code should be self-documenting. Use comments to explain complex logic, design decisions, or the intent behind a piece of code that might not be immediately obvious.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Keep it Concise**: Write short, clear sentences. Avoid long narratives.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. **Placement**:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n   - Place comments on the line immediately preceding the code block they describe.\\\\\\\\n   - Inline comments can be used to clarify individual lines, arguments, or variable declarations.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Formatting\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with the comment character followed by a single space (e.g., `# `, `// `).\\\\\\\\n- Use complete sentences with proper capitalization and punctuation.\\\\\\\\n- For multi-line comments, each line should begin with the comment character.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Function Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nFor functions, methods, or reusable components, provide a summary that includes:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n1. A brief description of its purpose.\\\\\\\\n1. An example of usage, including input and expected output.\\\\\\\\n1. (Optional) Type signatures if the language is dynamically typed.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n### Example (Nix)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```nix\\\\\\\\n# a basic function to fetch a specified user's public keys from github .keys url\\\\\\\\n# `fetchKeys \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"username` -> \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"ssh-rsa AAAA...== username@hostname\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n#@ String -> String\\\\\\\\nfetchKeys = username: (builtins.fetchurl \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"https://github.com/${username}.keys\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nUse standard tags to highlight specific information:\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` for planned features or improvements.\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` for known issues that need to be addressed.\\\\\\\\n# Comment Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General Formatting\\\\\\\\n- Use inline comments sparingly; prefer clear code over explanatory comments\\\\\\\\n- Start comments with capital letter, end with period for complete sentences\\\\\\\\n- Place comments on separate line above code, not trailing\\\\\\\\n- Use double-quote docstrings for all modules, classes, and functions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Docstring Patterns\\\\\\\\n- Required for all public classes, methods, and functions\\\\\\\\n- Format: Brief summary, blank line, detailed explanation, blank line, usage examples\\\\\\\\n- Include type information via type hints, not in docstrings\\\\\\\\n- Usage examples should show real-world invocation patterns\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nExample:\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nasync def add_file(self, path: Union[str, PathLike], mode: FileMode) -> bool:\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Add a file to the active context for AI awareness.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Supports wildcard patterns like 'byte/*' to add multiple files at once.\\\\\\\\n    Only adds files that are available in the FileDiscoveryService to ensure\\\\\\\\n    they are valid project files that respect gitignore patterns.\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await service.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"src/*.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.EDITABLE)` -> adds all Python files\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Special Tags\\\\\\\\n- `TODO:` - Planned feature or enhancement, include description\\\\\\\\n- `FIXME:` - Known bug or issue that needs attention\\\\\\\\n- `NOTE:` - Important explanation about non-obvious implementation\\\\\\\\n- Avoid `HACK:` and `XXX:` - refactor code instead\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Explain \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Why\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\" Not \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"What\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n- \\\\\\\\u274c `# Set the container` (obvious from code)\\\\\\\\n-

requirements\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Convention: PROJECT_TOOLING.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Project Tooling\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Build System\\\\\\\\n- **uv**: Modern Python package installer and resolver\\\\\\\\n- **pyproject.toml**: Project configuration, dependencies, and tool settings\\\\\\\\n- Build backend: `uv_build` (>= 0.8.10, < 0.9.0)\\\\\\\\n- Python: >= 3.12 required\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Key Dependencies\\\\\\\\n- **LangChain/LangGraph**: AI agent framework with graph-based workflows\\\\\\\\n- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management (v2.11+)\\\\\\\\n- **Rich**: Terminal UI rendering and formatting\\\\\\\\n- **Click**: CLI framework (entry point: `byte.core.cli:cli`)\\\\\\\\n- **prompt-toolkit**: Interactive command-line interface\\\\\\\\n- **GitPython**: Git repository operations\\\\\\\\n- **watchfiles**: File system monitoring\\\\\\\\n- **ripgrepy**: Fast file searching\\\\\\\\n- **aiosqlite**: Async database for checkpointing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Development Tools\\\\\\\\n- **Ruff**: Linting and formatting (replaces black, isort, flake8)\\\\\\\\n  - Target: Python 3.12\\\\\\\\n  - Enabled rules: E, F, I, LOG, UP, T10, ISC, ICN, G, PIE, PT, Q, RSE, FURB, RUF\\\\\\\\n  - Config: see [tool.ruff] in pyproject.toml\\\\\\\\n- **pytest**: Testing framework with async support (pytest-asyncio)\\\\\\\\n- **basedpyright**: Type checking (basic mode)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Environment Setup\\\\\\\\n- Use `.python-version` for version pinning (3.12)\\\\\\\\n- Optional: Nix flakes for reproducible environment (flake.nix)\\\\\\\\n- Optional: direnv for automatic environment activation (.envrc)\\\\\\\\n- Install: `uv sync` (installs all dependencies including dev group)\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Running\\\\\\\\n- Entry point: `uv run byte` or install and use `byte` command\\\\\\\\n- Scripts defined in pyproject.toml: `scripts.byte = \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"byte.core.cli:cli\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Convention: PYTHON_STYLEGUIDE.md\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nThis guide outlines Python coding standards for this project, based on established patterns in the codebase.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Type Annotations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Always use type hints** for all public methods, parameters, and return values\\\\\\\\n- Use `Union[str, PathLike]` for flexible path handling\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable values\\\\\\\\n- Import types under `TYPE_CHECKING` when needed to avoid circular imports\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nfrom typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional, Union\\\\\\\\nfrom os import PathLike\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nif TYPE_CHECKING:\\\\\\\\n    from byte.container import Container\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\ndef process_file(path: Union[str, PathLike]) -> Optional[str]:\\\\\\\\n    pass\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Dataclasses**: Use `@dataclass(frozen=True)` for immutable data containers\\\\\\\\n- **Abstract classes**: Use `ABC` and `@abstractmethod` for interfaces\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Accept container in `__init__` with proper typing\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\n@dataclass(frozen=True)\\\\\\\\nclass FileContext:\\\\\\\\n    path: Path\\\\\\\\n    mode: FileMode\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\nclass Command(ABC):\\\\\\\\n    def __init__(self, container: Optional[\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Container\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"] = None):\\\\\\\\n        self.container = container\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Documentation\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Class docstrings**: Brief purpose + usage example\\\\\\\\n- **Method docstrings**: Purpose + usage example for public methods\\\\\\\\n- **Inline comments**: Explain complex logic, not obvious code\\\\\\\\n- **Comment style**: Follow the [Comment Style Guide](COMMENT_STYLEGUIDE.md) for formatting and placement\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\nclass FileService:\\\\\\\\n    \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"Domain service orchestrating file operations and context management.\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n    Usage: `await

manager.add_file(\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"config.py\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\", FileMode.READ_ONLY)`\\\\\\\\n        \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Specific exceptions**: Catch specific exceptions, not broad `Exception`\\\\\\\\n- **Graceful degradation**: Return `False`/`None` rather than raising for expected failures\\\\\\\\n- **Resource cleanup**: Use context managers when appropriate\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n```python\\\\\\\\ntry:\\\\\\\\n    return self.path.read_text(encoding=\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\"utf-8\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\")\\\\\\\\nexcept (FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, UnicodeDecodeError):\\\\\\\\n    return None\\\\\\\\n```\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Code Organization\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Single responsibility**: Each class/method has one clear purpose\\\\\\\\n- **Dependency injection**: Use container pattern for loose coupling\\\\\\\\n- **Event-driven**: Emit events for cross-domain communication\\\\\\\\n- **Immutable data**: Prefer immutable objects where possible\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (`FileService`)\\\\\\\\n- **Methods/variables**: snake_case (`add_file`)\\\\\\\\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`FILE_MODE`)\\\\\\\\n- **Private members**: Leading underscore (`_files`)\\\\\\\\n# Python Style Guide\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## General\\\\\\\\n- Python 3.12+ required\\\\\\\\n- Use tabs for indentation (see .editorconfig)\\\\\\\\n- Ruff for linting and formatting (see pyproject.toml)\\\\\\\\n- Type hints mandatory for function signatures\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Imports\\\\\\\\n- Organize: stdlib, third-party, local (Ruff isort with combine-as-imports)\\\\\\\\n- Use absolute imports from `byte.` package root\\\\\\\\n- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies\\\\\\\\n- Example: `from byte.core.service.base_service import Service`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Naming Conventions\\\\\\\\n- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `FileService`, `CommandRegistry`)\\\\\\\\n- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `async def boot()`, `get_graph()`)\\\\\\\\n- Private methods: leading underscore (e.g., `_handle_stream_event()`)\\\\\\\\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (rare, prefer config classes)\\\\\\\\n- Service/Provider suffix for framework classes\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Async/Await\\\\\\\\n- Prefer async/await for I/O operations\\\\\\\\n- All service methods should be async\\\\\\\\n- Use `await self.make(ServiceClass)` for dependency injection\\\\\\\\n- Example: `file_service = await self.make(FileService)`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Type Hints\\\\\\\\n- Required for all function signatures\\\\\\\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable, `Union[A, B]` for alternatives\\\\\\\\n- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Type` from typing module\\\\\\\\n- Example: `async def execute(self, request: Any, thread_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:`\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Class Design\\\\\\\\n- Inherit from base classes: `Service`, `Command`, `Agent`, `Node`\\\\\\\\n- Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns: `Bootable`, `Injectable`, `Eventable`, `Configurable`\\\\\\\\n- Implement required abstract methods from base classes\\\\\\\\n- Override `async def boot()` for initialization logic\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Error Handling\\\\\\\\n- Create custom exceptions inheriting from domain-specific base (e.g., `EditFormatError`)\\\\\\\\n- Use descriptive exception names (e.g., `ReadOnlyFileError`, `SearchContentNotFoundError`)\\\\\\\\n- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully in long-running operations\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\n## Project Structure\\\\\\\\n- Domain-driven design: `src/byte/domain/{domain}/`\\\\\\\\n- Each domain has: `config.py`, `service_provider.py`, `service/`, `command/`\\\\\\\\n- Core framework in `src/byte/core/`\\\\\\\\n- Tests mirror source structure

(`FileService`)\\n- **Methods/variables**: snake_case (`add_file`)\\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`FILE_MODE`)\\n- **Private members**: Leading underscore (`_files`)\\n# Python Style Guide\\n\\n## General\\n- Python 3.12+ required\\n- Use tabs for indentation (see .editorconfig)\\n- Ruff for linting and formatting (see pyproject.toml)\\n- Type hints mandatory for function signatures\\n\\n## Imports\\n- Organize: stdlib, third-party, local (Ruff isort with combine-as-imports)\\n- Use absolute imports from `byte.` package root\\n- TYPE_CHECKING imports for circular dependencies\\n- Example: `from byte.core.service.base_service import Service`\\n\\n## Naming Conventions\\n- Classes: PascalCase (e.g., `FileService`, `CommandRegistry`)\\n- Functions/methods: snake_case (e.g., `async def boot()`, `get_graph()`)\\n- Private methods: leading underscore (e.g., `_handle_stream_event()`)\\n- Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (rare, prefer config classes)\\n- Service/Provider suffix for framework classes\\n\\n## Async/Await\\n- Prefer async/await for I/O operations\\n- All service methods should be async\\n- Use `await self.make(ServiceClass)` for dependency injection\\n- Example: `file_service = await self.make(FileService)`\\n\\n## Type Hints\\n- Required for all function signatures\\n- Use `Optional[T]` for nullable, `Union[A, B]` for alternatives\\n- Use `List`, `Dict`, `Type` from typing module\\n- Example: `async def execute(self, request: Any, thread_id: Optional[str] = None) -> None:`\\n\\n## Class Design\\n- Inherit from base classes: `Service`, `Command`, `Agent`, `Node`\\n- Use mixins for cross-cutting concerns: `Bootable`, `Injectable`, `Eventable`, `Configurable`\\n- Implement required abstract methods from base classes\\n- Override `async def boot()` for initialization logic\\n\\n## Error Handling\\n- Create custom exceptions inheriting from domain-specific base (e.g., `EditFormatError`)\\n- Use descriptive exception names (e.g., `ReadOnlyFileError`, `SearchContentNotFoundError`)\\n- Handle `KeyboardInterrupt` and `asyncio.CancelledError` gracefully in long-running operations\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n- Domain-driven design: `src/byte/domain/{domain}/`\\n- Each domain has: `config.py`, `service_provider.py`, `service/`, `command/`\\n- Core framework in `src/byte/core/`\\n- Tests mirror source structure in `src/tests/`\\n\\n\"], [\"user\", \"\\n# System Context\\n\\nCurrent date: 2025-10-07\\n\"]], \"file_context\": \"# Here are the files in the current context:\\n\\n\\n*Trust this
