# Concepts

Byte's design revolves around key principles that work together to provide a powerful yet safe environment for AI-assisted development:

- [Memory & Context Management](memory.md) - Understanding token usage, context limits, and session management
- [File Context](file-context.md) - Control which files the AI can see and modify
- [File Watching](file-watching.md) - Automatic detection of external file changes
- [Conventions](conventions.md) - Project-specific coding standards and style guides
- [Linting](lint.md) - Automated code quality checks and fixes
- [Commit](commit.md) - AI-powered commit message generation
- [Web](web.md) - Scrape webpages and convert to markdown for LLM context
