## Core Concepts

- **[File Context](file-context.md)** - Control which files the AI can see and modify
- **[File Watching](file-watching.md)** - Automatic detection of external file changes
- **[Conventions](conventions.md)** - Project-specific coding standards and style guides

## Understanding File Management

Byte's file management system revolves around three key ideas:

1. **Context Control** - Explicitly manage which files the AI can access
2. **Permission Modes** - Distinguish between reference and editable files
3. **Automatic Discovery** - Fast file operations through intelligent caching

These concepts work together to provide a powerful yet safe environment for AI-assisted development.
